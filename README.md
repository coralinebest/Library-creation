#  Wild Fires in France

## Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze the phenomenon of wild fires in France using data with information on wild fires in the country from 1973 to the present. We will perform data cleansing, extract key indicators, create visualizations, build a Python library called PrometheusLib, and implement a command line interface for user interaction.



### 4. Build a Library
Build a Python library named "PrometheusLib" that contains all the functions developed in the project. 

### 5. Command Line
Create a command-line interface that displays key indicators and stores the generated graphs. Users should be able to choose a specific year and department (or select all) when executing the command line.
