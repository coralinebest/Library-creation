#  Wild Fires in France

## Overview
In this project, I aim to analyze the phenomenon of wild fires in France using data with information on wild fires in the country from 1973 to the present. I will perform data cleansing, extract key indicators, create visualizations.

### Build a Library
Build a Python library named "PrometheusLib" that contains all the functions developed in the project. 

###  Command Line
Create a command-line interface that displays key indicators and stores the generated graphs. Users should be able to choose a specific year and department (or select all) when executing the command line.
